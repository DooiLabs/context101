> Context101 is an MCP server that works inside your AI code editor.

💬 **AI-native courses inside your editor** : Learn by building with AI. Whether you’re using Cursor or another AI code editor, Context101 guides you through real projects (like building a website) while teaching how to learn and work with AI in the AI era.

🤖 **Structured learning, powered by MCP** : Context101 provides structured courses as an MCP, making learning with AI more effective. Instead of unstructured AI chats, Context101 organizes conversations into clear, step-by-step learning flows.

🧠 **Personalized learning roadmap** : Context101 remembers your questions, struggles, and progress. By asking the right follow-up questions as you learn, it continuously refines a roadmap tailored just for you.


Traditional courses (like Udemy, Coursera) take 100+ hours. Context101 gets you building a website in about an hour.  Have fun learning with Context101!


## Quick Start

#### Method 1: CLI Installation (Recommended)

One command to install and configure MCP for your IDE:

```bash
npx @context101/mcp
```

Supported clients: cursor, windsurf, cline, claude

#### Method 2: Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup, add this to your IDE's MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context101": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@context101/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```


> Config file locations:

- Cursor: ~/.cursor/mcp.json
- Windsurf: ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
- Cline: ~/.cline/mcp_config.json
- Claude: ~/.claude/mcp_config.json

Once installed, just talk to your editor as usual:

```txt
Teach me React step-by-step by building a small project.
```
That's it! Now your AI code editor would act like a tutor, with structured courses.
