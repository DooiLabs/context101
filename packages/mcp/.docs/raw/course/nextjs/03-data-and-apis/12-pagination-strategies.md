# Pagination Strategies

Use cursor-based pagination for scale.

Expose `cursor` in API responses.

## Why this matters
Data is where most apps get complex. Clear server/client boundaries and predictable APIs
reduce bugs and security risks.

## Key ideas
- Validate inputs on the server
- Keep secrets out of client components
- Prefer server actions and route handlers for mutations

## Mini task
- Add a route handler that returns JSON
- Fetch it from a server component and render the result
## Summary
- You know what this concept is and where it fits in App Router
- You can apply the core pattern in a real project
- You can avoid the most common mistakes

## Checklist
- I can explain this concept in one paragraph
- I can implement a minimal example
- I know which file(s) this belongs to
