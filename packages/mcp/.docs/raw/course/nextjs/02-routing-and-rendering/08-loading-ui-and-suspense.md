# Loading UI and Suspense

Add `loading.tsx` for route-level skeletons.

Example:
```
app/
  products/
    loading.tsx
    page.tsx
```

Use Suspense for async parts.

## Why this matters
Routing in App Router is more than URLs—it defines how layouts, data, and UI streaming behave.
Understanding these primitives lets you build complex flows without custom routing libraries.

## Key ideas
- Layouts persist and can share data
- Suspense boundaries enable streaming UI
- Error and not-found boundaries provide safe fallbacks

## Mini task
- Add a new route segment and a nested layout
- Introduce a `loading.tsx` and confirm it shows during slow data
## Summary
- You know what this concept is and where it fits in App Router
- You can apply the core pattern in a real project
- You can avoid the most common mistakes

## Checklist
- I can explain this concept in one paragraph
- I can implement a minimal example
- I know which file(s) this belongs to

## Practice Tasks
1. Create a minimal example related to this step and run it locally.
2. Write a short note explaining why this concept matters in the App Router.

## Code Examples
```tsx
// Example 1: Minimal pattern for this step
export default function Example() {
  return <div>Replace with a working example</div>;
}
```

```tsx
// Example 2: Variation or extension
export function ExampleVariant() {
  return <section>Replace with a second example</section>;
}
```
