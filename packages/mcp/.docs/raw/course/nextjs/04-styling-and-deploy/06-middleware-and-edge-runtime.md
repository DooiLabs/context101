# Middleware and Edge Runtime

Middleware runs before a request is completed. It is useful for auth, redirects, and localization.

Create `middleware.ts` at the project root:

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const isLoggedIn = req.cookies.get("session")?.value;
  if (!isLoggedIn && req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/dashboard")) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", req.url));
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/dashboard/:path*"],
};
```

Notes:
- Runs on the edge by default
- Keep it fast (no heavy DB calls)
- Use it for routing logic, not full business logic

## Why this matters
Styling and deployment choices affect performance, DX, and long-term maintainability.
A stable design system and a reliable deploy pipeline prevent last-minute issues.

## Key ideas
- Keep styles scoped by default
- Optimize assets and images
- Define a deploy checklist and stick to it

## Mini task
- Add a global theme token and use it in a component
- Run a production build and inspect output
## Common pitfalls
- Heavy DB calls in middleware
- Accessing Node APIs not available in Edge Runtime
## Summary
- You know what this concept is and where it fits in App Router
- You can apply the core pattern in a real project
- You can avoid the most common mistakes

## Checklist
- I can explain this concept in one paragraph
- I can implement a minimal example
- I know which file(s) this belongs to
